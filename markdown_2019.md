Together with KSat e.V. (the Small Satellite Student Society) from the University of Stuttgart and the Distributed Ground Station Network Team at the Institute for Photogrammetry we are working on the rover mission ROACH crawling for maintenance reasons on the outer hull of a sounding rocket while coasting in near space or tracking cubesats faster than US NORAD. With the Cosmic Dust Team of the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart we are simulating cometary dust particles for the IMEX project of the European Space Agency (ESA). And now with our newest umbrella team, the ep2lab of Charles III University of Madrid, we are also involved in simulating and building propulsion systems for space applications.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Now with the efforts to build the very first open digital cinema camera AXIOM from scratch the apertus° project has evolved to the next level: into a platform for film-makers, creative industry professionals, artists and enthusiasts. apertus° is more than just a software/hardware collection, it's a knowledge library, an ecosystem of people supporting each other and advocating freedom.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ApertusOSCinema', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://www.apertus.org/irc-chat', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'team@apertus.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.apertus.org/mailinglists', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                          | https://lab.apertus.org/project/board/20/                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:32.890510Z | ['c', 'linux', 'fpga', 'vhdl', 'embedded']                                        | ['embedded systems', 'vision', 'camera', 'image processing', 'fpga']                                                                       | ['Media']                    |

In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration platform; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world. Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'contact@catrobat.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://catrob.at/mailinglist', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | http://developer.catrobat.org/gsoc_2019_ideas_page.html                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:47.792460Z | ['android', 'java', 'swift', 'symfony']                                           | ['web', 'app development', 'visual programming', 'gaming']                                                                                 | ['Programming languages']    |

CROSS turns OSS prototypes into successful open source software projects. The Center was created in 2015 inspired by the story of UCSC alumni (and CROSS benefactor) Sage Weil, who turned his research prototype Ceph into a multi-million dollar company. We draw from the expertise of our affiliated experts and industry members to choose projects that will have maximum real world impact. Our projects are mentored and guided by a team of experts chosen specifically to best ensure success.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/@cross_ucsc', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/uccross/gsoc', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'cross-info@ucsc.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://cross.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://cross.ucsc.edu/news/index.html', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                     | https://github.com/uccross/uccross.github.io/blob/master/gsoc19.md                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:37.536171Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'c/c++', 'verilog']                                      | ['cloud databases', 'reproducibility', 'ceph', 'architecture', 'generative text']                                                          | ['Other']                    |

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions.

However, its importance raises important questions about the open source ecosystem. Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact. Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members. Open source companies want to know which communities and software to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.

These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

We have created around 20 <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction" target="_blank">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers" target="_blank">many more</a>.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality.

Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/project_cloudcv', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/Cloud-CV/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'team@cloudcv.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                    | https://gsoc.cloudcv.org/                                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:51.312636Z | ['django', 'python 3', 'docker', 'angularjs', 'aws']                              | ['machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer vision', 'deep-learning']                                                        | ['Infrastructure and cloud'] |

If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. For example, our web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'helikarlab@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/helikarlab-gsoc', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | http://helikarlab.org/GSoC2019.html                                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:40.209472Z | ['postgresql', 'javascript', 'react', 'webgl']                                    | ['bioinformatics', 'web application', 'data science', 'computational biology', 'network biology']                                          | ['Science and medicine']     |

To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update" target="_blank">https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href="https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/" target="_blank">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

First, <em>compile-time evaluation</em> allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, <em>static introspection</em> allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as "Design by Introspection". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole.

While the Web2.0 technologies opened up much of the “guts” of websites for third-parties to reuse and repurpose data on the Web, they still require that developers create one client per target API.

All of it free.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Our mission is to contribute to open projects, and the people we contract to improve the technology become Open Source developers.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Let's make something amazing | <p>Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                        | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/drupal', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://drupal.slack.com/messages/C2ESCQHNX', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'lechleider.matthew@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.drupal.org/google-summer-code', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://www.drupal.org/planet', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                          | https://groups.drupal.org/node/534703                                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.252063Z | ['javascript', 'sql', 'php', 'symfony', 'drupal 8']                               | ['web application', 'web development', 'content management', 'backend', 'martech']                                                         | ['Web']                      |

Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is  the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack.

They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk. You can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ensembl', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'helpdesk@ensembl.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.ensembl.info/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                            | http://www.ensembl.info/about/student-projects/                                                            | 2022-01-13T14:53:48.390743Z | ['python', 'mysql', 'javascript', 'perl', 'rest']                                 | ['databases', 'genomics', 'scientific visualization', 'data analysis']                                                                     | ['Science and medicine']     |

Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes).

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/gentoo', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2019/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2019/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://planet.gentoo.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]          | https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2019/Ideas                                              | 2022-01-13T14:53:48.160462Z | ['python', 'c/c++', 'shell script', 'linux kernel', 'bash']                       | ['operating systems', 'embedded systems', 'package management', 'init systems', 'application security']                                    | ['Operating systems']        |

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnss-sdr-developers', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://gnss-sdr.org/google-summer-code-2019-ideas-list/                                                   | 2022-01-13T14:53:44.024671Z | ['c/c++', 'c++17', 'sdr', 'gnss', 'c++ libraries c++11 c++14 c++17 c++20']        | ['gnss', 'geolocation', 'navigation', 'software defined radio', 'communications']                                                          | ['Science and medicine']     |

In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

By not allowing side effects and dealing with immutable data, the compiler can avoid whole classes of bugs.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

We deal with the question of how the software development process can be improved. Through visualizations we make the abstract problems of software development more understandable and accessible. In recent years, we have built up a great deal of knowledge in this field and published at international scientific conferences together with scientists from all over the world. Since last year, we have concentrated to put scientific findings into practice. Our innovative open source project <a href="https://github.com/getaviz/Getaviz" target="_blank">Getaviz</a> transfers the knowledge of the scientific community of software visualization into helpful tools for software developers. With the support of our growing community we are designing visualizations for exploring the structure, behavior, and evolution of software artifacts in 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and augmented reality. We provide a highly creative environment with many modern technologies on transition between science and industry.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Most InterMines also have a "data sources" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

The ISC team has helped write those standards, as well as implement them. The Internet infrastructure projects we work on present very interesting problems, including performance, interoperability, flexibility, resilience, security, and even user experience. Major carriers and service providers use our software - as do schools, airports, hospitals and small businesses. <strong>Working on core infrastructure gives you an opportunity to have a significant impact. </strong></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

We keep in touch with on-line chat mailing lists, and frequent video conference calls.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

If you look at our user mailing lists or our GitLab issue trackers, you will see we have an active and vocal user community. Besides contributing directly to the main BIND or Kea projects, there are many other possible projects - including dashboards for metrics and status, configuration tools and maintenance and testing utilities.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries, which provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes.

Based on those variables you can then build your infrastructure conditionally to fit every kind of environment or code you want to deploy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

It is designed as an open source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station that is accessed via a web page for all of the network users. A basic ground station can be made up of commercial off the shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing 100+ stations are on-line in the <a href="https://network.satnogs.org" target="_blank">SatNOGS Network</a> and 50+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors.

It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there. Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly. The Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open source software both improving its administration and enabling open source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/_liquidgalaxy', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://liquidgalaxy.slack.com', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'liquidgalaxylab@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2017/08/gsoc-2019-project-ideas.html                                           | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.802443Z | ['python', 'android', 'nodejs', 'maps api']                                       | ['visualization', 'data', 'cluster', 'geo']                                                                                                | ['Other']                    |

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages.

Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP’s requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today’s focus on where — addresses and hosts — to what — the content that users and applications care about.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [{'url': 'http://twitter.com/nameddata', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://minindn.memphis.edu/ndnslack/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'info@named-data.net', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://named-data.net/codebase/platform/support/mailing-lists/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://reddit.com/r/ndn', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                           | https://named-data.net/gsoc-2019/#project-ideas                                                            | 2022-01-13T14:53:37.298291Z | ['javascript', 'android', 'java', 'c++14', 'c#']                                  | ['networking', 'informationc centric networking', 'ipfs']                                                                                  | ['Web']                      |

By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications.

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/cytoscape', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#profile-tab', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                               | https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues                                                          | 2022-01-13T14:53:47.151215Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'web', 'c++']                                    | ['web application', 'data science', 'graphics', 'scientific computing', 'network biology']                                                 | ['Science and medicine']     |

However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/nvAccess', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'info@nvaccess.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://sourceforge.net/p/nvda/lists/nvda-devel/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://www.nvaccess.org/category/in-process/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                      | https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas-List                                                 | 2022-01-13T14:53:30.969833Z | ['python', 'c++', 'ui automation', 'iaccessible2', 'win32 api']                   | ['accessibility', 'blindness', 'screen reader', 'braille', 'text to speech']                                                               | ['Other']                    |

Save lives.                                                          | <p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/openmrs', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/IRC/Home', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'community@openmrs.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://talk.openmrs.org/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://blog.openmrs.org', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                          | https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Summer+Of+Code+2019                                                   | 2022-01-13T14:53:40.129392Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'android', 'java', 'spring']                              | ['science and medicine', 'open source', 'medical record', 'developing countries']                                                          | ['Science and medicine']     |

Still, the success of OSM wouldn't be possible without open source software and volunteer developers.

For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href="https://www.cineca.it/en" target="_blank">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application.

Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

Lastly, we're moving to use software containers to make PEcAn even more light weight and easy to use as well as implementing an API to turn PEcAn into a SaaS product.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain-specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'ljmanso@ljmanso.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/robocomp-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://robocomp.github.io/web/blog/gsoc/ideas2019                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:40.961233Z | ['python', 'opencv', 'qt', 'c++11', 'component-based development']                | ['robotics', 'computer vision', 'multi-agent system', 'component-based development']                                                       | ['Other']                    |

We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code.

Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called "level playing field").</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/EclipseFdn', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'emo@eclipse.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/soc-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://planet.eclipse.org', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                | https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2019_Ideas                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.953573Z | ['javascript', 'java', 'jakarta', 'openj9']                                       | ['iot', 'cloud', 'ide']                                                                                                                    | ['Programming languages']    |

Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional intelligence, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time.

A Summer of Code project in Julia is an opportunity to work at the bleeding edge of any of these exciting fields.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/JuliaLanguage', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://julialang.org/community/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'summerofcode@julialang.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://discourse.julialang.org/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://julialang.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                              | https://julialang.org/soc/ideas-page                                                                       | 2022-01-13T14:53:48.997003Z | ['julia']                                                                         | ['machine learning', 'data science', 'scientific computing', 'numerical computing', 'technical computing']                                 | ['Science and medicine']     |

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.29 in January 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/about/statistics/" target="_blank">About/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users" target="_blank">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 220 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p> | [{'url': 'https://ns-3.zulipchat.com', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'consortium@nsnam.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.nsnam.org/support/mailing-lists/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2019Projects                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:32.361668Z | ['python', 'c/c++']                                                               | ['networking', 'research and development']                                                                                                 | ['Other']                    |

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/processingorg', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://discourse.processing.org/c/summer-of-code', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'foundation@processing.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/processing-foundation', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                      | https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List                                                 | 2022-01-13T14:53:31.447358Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'android', 'java', 'opengl']                             | ['education', 'web', 'graphics', 'creative coding', 'design']                                                                              | ['Programming languages']    |

We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data. The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis.

We accomplish this using a decoupled server-client architecture, where data is distributed across both public and private servers while being securely combined and visualized in one web-based browser.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ucscxena', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'genome-cancer@soe.ucsc.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xena-google-summer-of-code', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://github.com/ucscXena/ucsc-xena-client/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-Ideas-2019                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.192595Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'react', 'clojure']                                      | ['genomics', 'bioinformatics', 'scientific visualization', 'cancer research']                                                              | ['Science and medicine']     |

This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/xorgfoundation?lang=en', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://planet.freedesktop.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                          | https://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:25.555681Z | ['opengl', 'vulkan', 'x11', 'wayland', 'opencl']                                  | ['graphics stack', '3d acceleration', 'media acceleration', '2d acceleration', 'windowing system']                                         | ['Media']                    |

On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with applications, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                            |                             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |                              |

Each component on it's own is easy to understand, but once all the components interact, then new sounds can emerge and interesting modulation possibilities open up. Overall there are millions of parameters which can be manipulated from the user interface or via the open sound control API. With the collection of building blocks provided to users a powerful sound design tool is provided along with an interesting variety of development challenges.
