The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [{'url': 'https://beamcommunity.github.io/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'contact@process-one.net', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beam-community', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://github.com/beamcommunity/beamcommunity.github.com/wiki                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:44.198113Z | ['xmpp', 'erlang', 'elixir', 'beam', 'mqtt']                                                           | ['real time', 'cloud', 'messaging', 'scalability']                                                                                            | ['Programming languages']    |

Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. We do not assume that our project will derive the answer per se, but that the platform we are building can help crowdsource the future Internet. Linux XIA, our interoperable, meta network architecture implemented in the Linux kernel, offers an evolvable, collaborative framework, in which old and new designs can coexist and enrich each other.

CERN is one of the world’s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (<a href="http://info.cern.ch" target="_blank">http://info.cern.ch</a>), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html" target="_blank">http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html</a>) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.</p> | [{'url': 'sft-gsoc@cern.ch', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/article/198146#contact', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | http://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/article/198146                                                                           | 2022-01-13T14:53:42.510719Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'c++', 'clang']                                                               | ['machine learning', 'cloud', 'numerical and data analysis software', 'simulation software']                                                  | ['Science and medicine']     |

These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related mal-function can have on the rest of the cell.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/helikarlab', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'helikarlab@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/d/forum/helikarlab-gsoc', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | http://helikarlab.org/GSoC2016.html                                                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:38.250806Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'react', 'webgl']                                                              | ['computational biology', 'real time', 'networks', 'image analysis', 'systems biology']                                                       | ['Science and medicine']     |

You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Beside that "uncore" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: <a href="http://www.librecores.org" target="_blank">LibreCores.org</a>. We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

State-of-the-art algorithms then compute all Nash equilibria of the game after a mouse click, which are very difficult to compute manually.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ensembl', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'helpdesk@ensembl.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.ensembl.info/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | http://www.ensembl.info/gsoc/                                                                                          | 2022-01-13T14:53:47.173681Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'perl']                                                                        | ['databases', 'bioinformatics', 'web platform and services', 'data visualisation']                                                            | ['Science and medicine']     |

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+Gentoo', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/gentoo', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://planet.gentoo.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                          | https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/Ideas                                                          | 2022-01-13T14:53:46.491877Z | ['python', 'c/c++', 'perl', 'shell script', 'sql']                                                     | ['virtualization', 'operating systems', 'security', 'linux', 'embeddded']                                                                     | ['Operating systems']        |

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+GnsssdrOrgPage', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnss-sdr-developers', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | http://gnss-sdr.org/documentation/google-summer-code-2016-ideas-list                                                   | 2022-01-13T14:53:36.411578Z | ['c/c++', 'c++11', 'c++14', 'gnss']                                                                    | ['geolocation', 'navigation', 'software defined radio', 'communications']                                                                     | ['Social and communication'] |

In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as <a href="http://www.gpstk.org" target="_blank">GPSTk</a> or <a href="http://www.rtklib.com/" target="_blank">RTKLIB</a>).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

For now, it consists of an Polymer based front end for routing, visualization and prototyping as well as a Go based back end for the database, routing algorithms and integration. The front end is made of different components to integrate all the necessary technologies to enable mobile access, prototyping of new routing algorithms, visualizations, interchangeable maps (Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSM, ....); the back end combines efficient database work with data from different sources like height profiles or temperature.

Coordinated by the Global Infrastructures Research Group at Department of Informatics of the University of Oslo, the network has since 1994 been involved in many countries in the "Global South". At the core of the programme is the development of the open source DHIS software and the use of this application to strengthen country health information systems. The DHIS 2 software is used in more than 45 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the South Pacific, and countries that have adopted DHIS 2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and organizations are starting up new deployments. We are involved in multi-disciplinary research with a focus on action-research with 7 professors, about 35 active PhD students, many masters students and many software developers from different implementing organizations worldwide.

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [{'url': 'https://webchat.freenode.net/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'jpf.gsoc@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://groups.google.com/group/java-pathfinder', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://jpf.byu.edu/gsoc16/projects/projects.html                                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.062225Z | ['android', 'java', 'distributed systems', 'jvm']                                                      | ['testing', 'verification', 'model checking', 'program analysis', 'environment generation']                                                   | ['Programming languages']    |

This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [{'url': 'http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mlpack', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'https://lists.cc.gatech.edu/mailman/listinfo/mlpack', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:27.311199Z | ['c++']                                                                                                | ['machine learning', 'data mining', 'fast algorithms']                                                                                        | ['Science and medicine']     |

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and cell-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/cytoscape', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cytoscape-discuss', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc-reports.html', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues                                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:46.706687Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'c++', 'php']                                                         | ['web', 'bioinformatics', 'biology', 'systems biology', 'dataviz']                                                                            | ['Science and medicine']     |

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+nmap', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/nmap', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'fyodor@nmap.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://insecure.org', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://nmap.org/soc/                                                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:30.936894Z | ['c', 'python', 'c/c++', 'lua', 'c++']                                                                 | ['security', 'networking', 'linux', 'ipv6', 'network mapping']                                                                                | ['Security']                 |

We are constantly in search of methods to have a 'detection' system as powerful as the human being. Given a random query image, we want to have a system capable of answering the questions like: What is present in the image? Is there a house in it? Is there a human in it? Where is the house located?  Questions like these which are so trivial to human beings, are extremely difficult for a computer - the same computer which is way faster than human beings in terms of sequential calculations and executions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [{'url': 'kripasindhu.sarkar@dfki.de', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opendetection/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | http://opendetection.com/idea_list_gsoc2016.html                                                                       | 2022-01-13T14:53:49.038437Z | ['c/c++', 'opencv', 'cmake', 'caffe', 'pcl']                                                           | ['machine learning', 'computer vision']                                                                                                       | ['Other']                    |

The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Most of it is carried out by scientists who need to tweak their tools in order to get their experiments to run, and almost none of it is shared. To reduce the need for such redundant development efforts, we created Open Ephys as a centralized hub for tool sharing. "Ephys" is short for "electrophysiology," which is the most common technique for recording the activity of neurons. Our main focus is on making it easier for neuroscientists to acquire data from many neurons simultaneously, and the Open Ephys GUI is the open-source, modular application that makes this possible. Our GUI, which takes inspiration from audio production software such as Ableton Live, is the most widely used open-source application of its kind.

Modern mobile devices allow new features like key exchange via QR or NFC, and support for secret keys stored on Yubikey devices.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/openkeychain', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/openkeychain', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://openkeychain.org', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2016                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:34.112643Z | ['android', 'openpgp']                                                                                 | ['security', 'e-mail', 'encryption']                                                                                                          | ['Security']                 |

Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Oppia provides tools that enable teachers, bloggers, professors and enthusiasts to create new explorations without needing to know how to code. Our exploration editor helps creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, and allows the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). We also hope to facilitate the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

We especially encourage projects with an academic bent, and software projects related to open hardware: we have mentors skilled in such matters.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [{'url': 'psu-gsoc-2016@svcs.cs.pdx.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://psu-gsoc-2016.blogspot.com/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/psu-gsoc/ideas.html                                                                             | 2022-01-13T14:53:28.905208Z | ['open hardware', 'language-agnostic']                                                                 | ['new projects', 'academic projects', 'individual projects']                                                                                  | ['Other']                    |

It can be used to analyse everything from the reliability of distributed file systems, to the performance of a Bluetooth-enabled wireless device, to the safety of a car's airbag control system. PRISM has been used by researchers worldwide in fields as diverse as quantum cryptography, systems biology, computer security and robotics. Development of PRISM is based at the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford, UK, but we have contributors worldwide.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run operating systems and programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance. When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, ARM, server and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/101344524535025574253', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'http://wiki.qemu.org/Links#Development', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'qemu-devel@nongnu.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://wiki.qemu.org/MailingLists', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | http://qemu-project.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2016                                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:30.140114Z | ['c', 'assembly', 'kvm']                                                                               | ['virtualization', 'operating systems', 'compilers', 'emulation']                                                                             | ['Other']                    |

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism. More cutting-edge software engineering technologies are being included in RoboComp to simplify the life-cycle of robotics components and to facility the deployment of very large networks of components that more a more start to resemble a "biological" computational device.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'https://gitter.im/orgs/robocomp/rooms', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'marcog@unex.es', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/robocomp-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://robocomp.github.io/website/Blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://robocomp.github.io/website/gsoc-2016-ideas/                                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:47.720120Z | ['python', 'c++', 'cmake', 'zeroc ice', 'gnu/linux']                                                   | ['robotics', 'computer vision', 'framework']                                                                                                  | ['Other']                    |

Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

The list has over 6,000 members from over 62 countries around the world. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers. Systers is the world’s largest community of women in technical roles in computing. It was founded by Anita Borg in 1987 together with 12 other women as a small electronic mailing list for women in “systems”. Systers continues to serve this purpose by providing women a private space to seek advice from their peers, and discuss the challenges they share as women technologists. Many Systers members credit the list for helping them make good career decisions, and steering them through difficult professional situations.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'http://twitter.com/JuliaLanguage', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://julialang.org/community/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'juliasoc@googlegroups.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://julialang.org/community/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://julialang.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | http://julialang.org/soc/ideas-page                                                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:26.946418Z | ['c', 'javascript', 'c++', 'julia', 'atom']                                                            | ['data science', 'statistics', 'linear algebra', 'numerical computation', 'integrated development environments']                              | ['Programming languages']    |

Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different! If that sounds interesting to you, please do send an application, or reach out to us at julia-users@googlegroups.com with any questions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

The PXF standard will allow phenotypic data to be captured at the point of publication, to be transmitted in the context of diagnostic testing, to be used for exchange of data in clinical studies, and as a backbone for patient-contributed data registries and social media.

At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers. The API exposed by HPX is modeled after the interfaces defined by the C++ ISO standard and adheres to the programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Rust and Java.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

These resources consist of language-processing dictionaries and grammars provided by contributors from several countries. Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=5', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'unitex-devel@univ-mlv.fr', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=17                                                                             | 2022-01-13T14:53:46.754233Z | ['java', 'c++']                                                                                        | ['natural language processing', 'local grammars', 'finite state automata', 'corpus annotation', 'multilingual language resources']            | ['Programming languages']    |

The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called <a href="http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=7" target="_blank">DELA</a>, internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

This includes traditional keyword queries but also query-by-example, query-by-sketch, and motion queries that rely on intrinsic vide features features such as, for instance, color, edge or motion information. At the user interface, sample images or sample videos (query-by-example), hand-drawn sketches (query-by-sketch) or flow fields (motion queries) and combinations thereof can be used. The system is composed of the flexible retrieval engine Cineast, and the storage back-end ADAM.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                        |                             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                               |                              |

X.Org develops the X Window System, the standard window system for open source operating systems and devices. Today, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. The X.Org Foundation Board of Directors is responsible for non-technical support and guidance of the X.Org project. X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/102057777074369211973', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/XOrgFoundation', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=dri-devel', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://planet.freedesktop.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                        | http://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/                                                                               | 2022-01-13T14:53:27.764224Z | ['c', 'opengl', 'c++', 'vulkan', 'opencl']                                                             | ['graphics']                                                                                                                                  | ['Media']                    |
