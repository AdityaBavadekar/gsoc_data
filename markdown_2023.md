Blender Foundation supports and facilitates these goals - even employs a staff for that - but fully depends on the online community to achieve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Our utility automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard. Each and every check also forces our users who are not familiar with these standards to read them and makes them think about why these standards exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/Checkstyle-GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas                                                                                                   |

The vision is to develop a community around the platform that will aid students to self-learn digital logic design. The platform is currently used by several universities worldwide. Apart from the simulator, users can create, learn, collaborate and share their work. Teachers can create groups and host assignments on the platform. The platform’s impact has been more evident than ever in the Covid 19 pandemic as CircuitVerse enabled schools and colleges to move their courses online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/GSoC'24-Project-List                                                                                                             |

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare and share state-of-the-art algorithms. We believe that one shouldn't have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn't have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://gsoc.cloudcv.org/                                                                                                                                                          |

CC licenses work in tandem with copyright, allowing creators to easily and legally change copyright terms from the default of “all rights reserved” to “some rights reserved” to best suit their needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://opensource.creativecommons.org/programs/project-ideas/                                                                                                                     |

It can freeze a running container (or an individual application) and checkpoint its state to disk. The data saved can be used to restore the application and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. Using this functionality, application or container live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are now possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://criu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_Ideas                                                                                                                                       |

Our communities either build decentralized wireless networks based on embedded networking hardware or extensively rely on FOSS components such as OpenWRT Linux, OLSR, BATMAN, Babel mesh routing daemons, libremesh, or retroshare applications. The contributions are made by individuals as well as local groups which are highly motivated to build open and free wireless networks providing Internet access to everybody. Moreover, we also create solutions that allow anonymous and secure communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://projects.freifunk.net                                                                                                                                                      |

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2024/Ideas                                                                                                                      |

The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration. | https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc24/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects                                                                                                         |

It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://wiki.octave.org/gsoc                                                                                                                                                       |

The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual "Bricks". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special "Bricks" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on "Pocket Code" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes.

Jenkins' motto is "Build great things at any scale". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices, algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost.

Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://github.com/metacall/gsoc-2024                                                                                                                                              |

Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months.

Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues                                                                                                                                  |

The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advises on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e.g. https://howto.gov.gr/ - https://forma.gov.gr/) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (https://openedtech.ellak.gr/ )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/gsoc2024/#/projects                                                                                                                                 |

The database, website and api running on our own servers, the editing tools used by contributors to improve the map, and many of the most popular libraries and end-user applications within the OSM software ecosystem are all open source software, and developed through a community-driven process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The openSUSE community is made up of multiple contributing communities that collaborate as part of a global open-source network. The openSUSE community develops, builds and maintains many of the packages, tools and infrastructure for the distribution. The community works together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the global Free and Open Source Software community. openSUSE creates one of the world's best Linux distributions, as well as a variety of tools, such as OBS, OpenQA, Kiwi, YaST, OSEM and Uyuni. Distributions include a rolling release (Tumbleweed), a stable annual release (Leap) and operating systems for edge, embedded, cloud and containers through MicroOS and ALP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://101.opensuse.org/                                                                                                                                                          |

Deploying AI in real applications is challenging and complex. We realized that and created OpenVINO – an open-source toolkit for bringing AI models to life on the most widespread and available platforms like x86 CPUs, but also Intel GPUs and NPUs that make up an AI PC. One can use OpenVINO to optimize own model for high performance with the most advanced model optimization capabilities and run those through OpenVINO runtime on various devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/Google-Summer-Of-Code                                                                                                             |

Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html                                                                                                                                     |

Our goal is to support people of all backgrounds in learning how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to tools and resources. We also believe that some of the most radical futures and innovative technologies are being built by communities that have been pushed to the margins by dominant tech. We hope to support those who have been marginalized by technology in continued self-determination by providing time, space, and resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/processing/Processing-Foundation-GSoC/wiki/Project-Ideas-List-(GSoC-2024)                                                                                       |

When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, ARM, server and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Since then the codebase has been rewritten multiple times, modularized and extended to support many new features. The Rizin project aims to provide stability, focus on the most important features, and provide a user friendly interface. Along with Cutter - a Qt-based GUI and the RzGhidra decompiler it makes the effective tool for everyday reversing tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://rizin.re/gsoc/2024/#project-ideas                                                                                                                                          |

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.scummvm.org/gsoc-2024-ideas                                                                                                                                            |

Logic bugs are bugs that cause a database system to compute an incorrect result for a given query and a database on which the query is executed. To that end, SQLancer semi-randomly generates databases and queries, whose results are then automatically validated. SQLancer has found hundreds of bugs in database systems such as SQLite, MySQL, DuckDB, CockroachDB, and TiDB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/wiki/GSoC-2024-Ideas                                                                                                                          |

Through Sugar's clarity of design, children and teachers have the opportunity to use computers on their own terms. Students can reshape, reinvent, and reapply both software and content into powerful learning activities. Sugar's focus on sharing, criticism, and exploration is grounded in the culture of free software (FLOSS)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://github.com/sugarlabs/GSoC/blob/master/Ideas-2024.md                                                                                                                        |

This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This offers massive portability and library support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2023 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and National University of Singapore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2023-Project-Ideas                                                                                                            |

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008.  The simulator is written in C++, with bindings for Python scripting, and uses the CMake build system.  We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and Zulip chat, but typically not other social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2024Projects                                                                                                                                        |

A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs.

We also felt these organizations often faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Beginning in 2022, we took over the programmatic responsibilities of the UCSC Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS), including mentorship activities such as GSoC. Following in line with the earlier work of CROSS, the OSPO creates partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the UC system in order to help students learn from open source communities, support scientists in using open source to accelerate research efforts, and connect students and scientists with sponsors from industry, government, and foundations. The OSPO helps bridge the gap between academic research and successful open source projects by promoting innovative projects maintained by UC-affiliated scientists and researchers.

Wikimedia officially supports 13 projects, including Wikipedia, the seventh most popular site on the internet. Wikipedia receives over 20 billion global page views every month and is available in over 300 languages. The tech behind it ensures that our projects are fast, reliable, and open to all. We design and build the open-source technology that powers Wikimedia projects from hosting Wikipedia to creating edit-checking artificial intelligence (AI). Community volunteers and Foundation technologists collaborate on MediaWiki, which makes sharing free knowledge possible.

Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/                                                                                                                                          |

On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers.
