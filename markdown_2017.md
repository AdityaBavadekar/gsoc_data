The server management  is done through a friendly user interface (the "platform”).

However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach our ultimate goal, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networking. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system, which we expect to deploy in production by the end of 2017. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [{'url': 'http://groups.google.com/group/linux-xia', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux/wiki/Ideas-list                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.300146Z | ['c', 'linux kernel', 'xia', 'advanced data structures']                                                | ['research', 'computer networking', 'future internet architecture']                                                                                                                                | ['Infrastructure and cloud'] |

Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'http://www.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=public:general:support', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gsoc@ccextractor.org', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://ccextractor.org/public:gsoc:ideas_page_for_summer_of_code_2017                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:29.621137Z | ['c', 'python', 'linux', 'raspberry pi', 'visual studio']                                               | ['subtitles', 'media', 'television', 'movies']                                                                                                                                                     | ['Media']                    |

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions.

These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Our utility automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard. Each and every check also forces our users who are not familiar with these standards to read them and makes them think about why these standards exist.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/108692338295483568100', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/checkstyle_java', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/checkstyle/checkstyle', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'checkstyle@googlegroups.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checkstyle-devel', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/Checkstyle-GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas                               | 2022-01-13T14:53:37.368762Z | ['java', 'antlr']                                                                                       | ['static code analysis\u200e', 'code review tool', 'coding standards', 'coding conventions']                                                                                                       | ['Programming languages']    |

As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality.

It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ClojureGSoC', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://clojurians.net/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'http://groups.google.com/group/clojure', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://clojure-gsoc.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | http://clojure-gsoc.org/project-ideas.html                                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:25.977198Z | ['javascript', 'clojure', 'clojurescript', 'jvm', 'functional programming']                             | ['compilers', 'functional programming', 'programming language', 'development tools', 'build systems']                                                                                              | ['Programming languages']    |

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'https://gitter.im/Cloud-CV', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gsoc@cloudcv.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | http://gsoc.cloudcv.org                                                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:44.610530Z | ['python', 'django', 'angularjs', 'deep learning', 'reactjs']                                           | ['machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'web development', 'computer vision', 'cloud computing']                                                                                           | ['Infrastructure and cloud'] |

These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable &amp; accurate quantitative analysis.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions.

We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Let's make something amazing | <p>Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems.

We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data.

It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation. It also includes formats that were invented by FFmpeg contributors and are in the process of being standardized now. The project provides: libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice, libpostproc, libswscale and libswresample which are used by many third party applications, higher level multimedia frameworks and video uploading sites on the internet. FFmpeg also includes the command line utilities ffmpeg, ffserver, ffplay and ffprobe which are used by end users for transcoding, streaming and playback of multimedia content.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+ffmpeg', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/FFmpeg', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://ffmpeg.org/contact.html#IRCChannels', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2017                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:49.061939Z | ['c', 'assembly', 'git']                                                                                | ['audio', 'video', 'multimedia', 'filter', 'compressio']                                                                                                                                           | ['Media']                    |

From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/freebsd', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIRC', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'soc-admins@FreeBSD.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://planet.FreeBSD.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas                                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:26.027909Z | ['shell', 'c/c++', 'llvm', 'assembly', 'make']                                                          | ['virtualization', 'security', 'cloud', 'kernel', 'embedded']                                                                                                                                      | ['Operating systems']        |

This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ensembl', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'helpdesk@ensembl.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.ensembl.info/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | http://www.ensembl.info/gsoc-2017/                                                                             | 2022-01-13T14:53:31.864683Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'perl']                                                                         | ['web', 'genomics']                                                                                                                                                                                | ['Science and medicine']     |

Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes).

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+Gentoo', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/gentoo', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://planet.gentoo.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                  | https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017/Ideas                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:42.839479Z | ['python', 'shell', 'linux', 'c/c++']                                                                   | ['security', 'linux', 'embedded', 'operating system', 'package management']                                                                                                                        | ['Operating systems']        |

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnss-sdr-developers', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | http://gnss-sdr.org/google-summer-code-2017-ideas-list/                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:28.827510Z | ['c/c++', 'c++', 'c++11', 'c++14', 'gnss']                                                              | ['gnss', 'geolocation', 'navigation', 'software defined radio', 'communications']                                                                                                                  | ['Science and medicine']     |

In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

We have adapted it to work beyond the framework of a single corporate entity via federated efforts of individuals and companies with distinct interests in the technology (cloud infrastructure, storage systems, application servers, and others), sharing an interest in commodity hardware and production-driven innovation.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parametrizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/IAI_Bremen', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/iai_gsoc17/general', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gsoc2017iai@uni-bremen.de', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://gsoc2017-at-iai@uni-bremen.de', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://ai.uni-bremen.de', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://ai.uni-bremen.de/teaching/gsoc2017                                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:43.362632Z | ['python', 'ros', 'c++', 'lisp', 'prolog']                                                              | ['machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'robotics', 'knowledge representation', 'robot perception']                                                                                        | ['Science and medicine']     |

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is written in C++ and Python, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/jderobot?lang=en', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'josemaria.plaza@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://jderobot.org/Collaborate#Mailing_List', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | http://jderobot.org/Collaborate#Ideas_List_.28for_Google_Summer_of_Code_2017.29                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.988536Z | ['python', 'c/c++', 'ros', 'gazebo']                                                                    | ['robotics', 'computer vision', 'teaching', 'robot simulator']                                                                                                                                     | ['Other']                    |

The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Jitsi is based on the OSGi (<a href="http://osgi.org" target="_blank">http://osgi.org</a>) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'http://twitter.com/llvmorg', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://llvm.org/docs/#irc', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://blog.llvm.org', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc17                                                                       | 2022-01-13T14:53:41.441356Z | ['llvm', 'clang']                                                                                       | ['compilers', 'compiler']                                                                                                                                                                          | ['Programming languages']    |

The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility, security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too. In fact, each component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different programming language.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'gsoc@microkernel.info', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | http://gsoc.microkernel.info/                                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:25.797125Z | ['c', 'c++', 'rust', 'arm', 'x86']                                                                      | ['virtualization', 'desktop', 'microkernel', 'components', 'ipc']                                                                                                                                  | ['Operating systems']        |

Our cooperation dates back to 2012 when we first met at the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/" target="_blank">FOSDEM</a> conference in Brussels and organized the first track (a.k.a. a devroom) entirely dedicated to microkernels and related technologies. The <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/" target="_blank">Microkernel devroom</a> has since become a de facto institutionalized feature of each FOSDEM.

Our continuing mission is to provide these users with an open source DJ application with features that rival and lead proprietary commercial solutions such as Traktor, Serato, and Virtual DJ.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/+mixxx', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/mixxxdj', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://mixxx.org/irc', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gsoc2017-mentors@mixxx.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://mixxxblog.blogspot.com/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/gsoc2017ideas                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:30.051674Z | ['c++', 'qt', 'c++11', 'midi', 'hid']                                                                   | ['music', 'audio', 'dj', 'dsp', 'art']                                                                                                                                                             | ['Media']                    |

Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mlpack', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'mlpack@lists.mlpack.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.mlpack.org/mailman/listinfo/mlpack', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.mlpack.org/gsocblog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:32.903579Z | ['c++']                                                                                                 | ['machine learning']                                                                                                                                                                               | ['Data']                     |

Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/cytoscape', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc-reports.html', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues                                                              | 2022-01-13T14:53:45.562476Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'c++', 'php']                                                          | ['web', 'database', 'graphics', 'ui/ux', 'network biology']                                                                                                                                        | ['Science and medicine']     |

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

We are constantly in search of methods to have a 'detection' system as powerful as the human being. Given a random query image, we want to have a system capable of answering the questions like: What is present in the image? Is there a house in it? Is there a human in it? Where is the house located? Questions like these which are so trivial to human beings, are extremely difficult for a computer - the same computer which is way faster than human beings in terms of sequential calculations and executions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [{'url': 'kripasindhu.sarkar@dfki.de', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opendetection/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | http://opendetection.com/idea_list_gsoc2017.html                                                               | 2022-01-13T14:53:39.214098Z | ['opencv', 'c++', 'caffe', 'pcl']                                                                       | ['computer vision', 'ai']                                                                                                                                                                          | ['Other']                    |

Save Lives.                                                          | <p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (<a href="http://regenstrief.org" target="_blank">http://regenstrief.org</a>), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (<a href="http://pih.org" target="_blank">http://pih.org</a>), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p> | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/openmrs', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://irc.openmrs.org/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'community@openmrs.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://talk.openmrs.org/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://openmrs.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | http://om.rs/soc2017                                                                                           | 2022-01-13T14:53:40.362009Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'java', 'hibernate', 'html/css']                                                | ['medical records', 'clinical', 'developing world']                                                                                                                                                | ['Science and medicine']     |

For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href="https://www.cineca.it/en" target="_blank">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application.

Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again.

Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.  An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run operating systems and programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance. When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, ARM, server and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'https://plus.google.com/101344524535025574253', 'name': 'G+'}, {'url': 'http://www.qemu-project.org/contribute/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'qemu-devel@nongnu.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://wiki.qemu-project.org/MailingLists', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2017                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.780078Z | ['c', 'python']                                                                                         | ['virtualization', 'emulation', 'compiler', 'hypervisor']                                                                                                                                          | ['Other']                    |

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. For GSoC 2015, our focus was audio parsing. For GSoC 2016, our focus was multimodal machine learning. For GSoC 2017, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [{'url': 'https://gitter.im/robocomp/home', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'marcog@unex.es', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/robocomp-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://robocomp.github.io/website/Blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | http://robocomp.github.io/website/2017/02/07/gsoc17ideas/                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:32.114252Z | ['python', 'c++', 'qt', 'cmake', 'openscenegraph']                                                      | ['robotics', 'computer vision', 'robotics simulation']                                                                                                                                             | ['Other']                    |

Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/rails', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://rubyonrails.org/community/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-gsoc', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/2017-Ideas                                                             | 2022-01-13T14:53:25.739619Z | ['ruby on rails', 'ruby', 'html']                                                                       | ['web', 'full stack']                                                                                                                                                                              | ['Web']                      |

It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives.

We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code.

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their "customers," and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

The list has over 6,000 members from over 62 countries around the world. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers. Systers is the world’s largest community of women in technical roles in computing. It was founded by Anita Borg in 1987 together with 12 other women as a small electronic mailing list for women in “systems”.

Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software for students by students, students can relate to the problem domain better. The scale of the system is big enough (~150 KLoC) without being overwhelming.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'https://webchat.freenode.net', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'jpf.gsoc@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/java-pathfinder', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://jpf.byu.edu/gsoc17/projects/projects.html                                                              | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.296255Z | ['android', 'java', 'distributed systems', 'jvm']                                                       | ['testing', 'verification', 'model checking', 'program analysis', 'environment generation']                                                                                                        | ['Programming languages']    |

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

While young among programming languages, at just over five years since its public release, it's rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around 150,000 users (and growing) have together built over 1300 packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance.

Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great way not only to build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

As one of the primary means of building and installing open source software on OS X, MacPorts is an important interface between Mac OS and the rest of the open source world.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/macports', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23macports', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'macports-dev@lists.macports.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://trac.macports.org/wiki/MailingLists', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SummerOfCode                                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:29.259754Z | ['make', 'git', 'tcl']                                                                                  | ['package manager', 'mac os x', 'macos']                                                                                                                                                           | ['End user applications']    |

Users of <em>ns-3</em> can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in <em>ns-3</em> is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/" target="_blank">web site</a>, but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of <em>ns-3</em> is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.  We operate as an GPLv2 open source project with an associated consortium and steering committee to provide administrative support to the project.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |

Our web-based data browser helps scientists make inferences and test hypotheses. Unique and important in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to combine their private data securely with public data using a decoupled server-client architecture. We are funded for the next 5 years by the National Cancer Institute as a genomic data visualization center to develop tools to visualize the largest compendium of cancer genomics data, the Genomic Data Commons. While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users.

ViSP was designed to be independent from the hardware, to be simple to use, expandable and cross-platform. ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'https://visp.inria.fr', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'visp-gsoc-2017@inria.fr', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/visp-gsoc-2017', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://github.com/lagadic/visp/wiki/GSoC_2017                                                                 | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.522457Z | ['c++', 'vision']                                                                                       | ['robotics', 'vision']                                                                                                                                                                             | ['Media']                    |

It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'http://www.wxwidgets.org/support/irc/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'wx-dev@googlegroups.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://www.wxwidgets.org/support/mailing-lists/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | http://www.wxwidgets.org/gsoc/projects/                                                                        | 2022-01-13T14:53:29.544999Z | ['c++', 'gtk+', 'win32', 'cocoa']                                                                       | ['desktop', 'cross-platform', 'gui']                                                                                                                                                               | ['Programming languages']    |

On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers.

The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                              |
