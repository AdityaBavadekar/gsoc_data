Smart agreements promise to reduce friction and transaction costs in the creation and management of contracts and commercial relationships. Enabling this future requires the necessary tools to format, share, execute, and manage legally enforceable machine-readable agreements. establishes and maintains a technology neutral foundation for smart legal contracts. The goal is to provide universal technology and tooling that introduces a common format for smart agreements, reducing the need to adopt and learn different technologies and future-proofing templates. Moreover, this facilitates the use of executable agreements across any infrastructure: cloud, blockchain, IoT.

When he left Google a few dedicated people picked it up and created a community version, afl++, that is actively developed with state-of-the art ideas coming from research and industry. In not even two years afl++ has become the most effective fuzzer (based on Google's Fuzzbench benchmarking), is actively developed and maintained and was just integrated into Google's oss-fuzz. It is now part of the critical infrastructure to identify security vulnerabilities in source code.

Now with the efforts to build the very first open digital cinema camera AXIOM from scratch the apertus° project has evolved to the next level: into a platform for film-makers, creative industry professionals, artists and enthusiasts. apertus° is more than just a software/hardware collection, it's a knowledge library, an ecosystem of people supporting each other and advocating freedom.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/ApertusOSCinema', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://www.apertus.org/irc-chat', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'team@apertus.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.apertus.org/mailinglists', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                          | https://lab.apertus.org/project/view/20/                                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:33.782075Z | ['linux', 'c/c++', 'fpga', 'vhdl', 'embedded']                                      | ['computer vision', 'camera', 'image processing', 'computational photography', 'digital imaging']                        | ['Media']                    |

The applications that run on these systems have the probability of a complete request-response cycle without any errors nowhere close to 1. The existing monitoring tools are tough to capture these events, even in their full potential which is obvious due to the learning curve, lack of a normal end-user based simplicity and missing out on some useful parameters.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/BenchRoutes', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/bench-routes/community', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'benchroutes@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://github.com/bench-routes/bench-routes/wiki/GSoC-2021-Idea-List                                                            | 2022-01-13T14:53:35.951435Z | ['react', 'golang', 'docker']                                                       | ['monitoring', 'web', 'devops', 'time-series']                                                                           | ['End user applications']    |

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Our utility automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard. Each and every check also forces our users who are not familiar with these standards to read them and makes them think about why these standards exist.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/checkstyle_java', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/checkstyle/checkstyle', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'checkstyle@googlegroups.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checkstyle-devel', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                    | https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/Checkstyle-GSoC-2021-Project-Ideas                                                 | 2022-01-13T14:53:50.624338Z | ['java', 'antlr']                                                                   | ['static code analysis\u200e', 'code review tool', 'coding standards', 'coding conventions']                             | ['Programming languages']    |

Besides providing traditional network-level security, the flexibility of eBPF enables security with the context of application protocols and DNS requests/responses. Cilium is tightly integrated with Envoy and provides an extension framework based on Go. Because eBPF runs inside the Linux kernel, all Cilium functionality can be applied without any changes to the application code or container configuration.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non-interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.

It can freeze a running container (or an individual application) and checkpoint its state to disk. The data saved can be used to restore the application and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. Using this functionality, application or container live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are now possible. CRIU is integrated with lots of 3rd party projects such as podman, open-mpi, runc, etc.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/__criu__', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'criu@openvz.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.openvz.org/mailman/listinfo/criu', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://criu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_Ideas                                                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:31.025374Z | ['c', 'python', 'linux kernel']                                                     | ['operating systems', 'containers', 'live migration', 'checkpoint-restore']                                              | ['Operating systems']        |

To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/news/cdli-core-update" target="_blank">https://cdli.ucla.edu/news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href="https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/" target="_blank">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations.

The whole extraction includes 125 languages. It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata). Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first open KGs on the Web. Its knowledge base has several advantages over existing ones: it covers many domains; it represents real community agreement; it automatically evolves as Wikipedia changes, and it is truly multilingual. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph.

In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Fortran-lang's flagship projects are the Fortran Standard Library (stdlib, <a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib" target="_blank">https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib</a>), Fortran Package Manager (fpm, <a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm" target="_blank">https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm</a>), and the Fortran website (<a href="https://fortran-lang.org" target="_blank">https://fortran-lang.org</a>). In only 14 months, stdlib has had &gt;140 pull requests merged from 23 contributors, with a total of 43 new procedures and types over 11 modules, and continues to grow. Largely modeled after Rust's Cargo, fpm is a build system and package manager dedicated to Fortran with the key goal to improve programmer happiness. Fpm is already capable of building complex Fortran projects, automatically fetching and building dependencies, and bootstrapping itself. The Fortran website provides all the latest information about Fortran compilers, libraries, and community, as well as an actively developed tutorial. Fortran-lang issues monthly newsletters that detail the relevant news and updates to the projects, and distributes them on Twitter and on its mailing list. Finally, the Fortran Discourse (<a href="https://fortran-lang.discourse.group" target="_blank">https://fortran-lang.discourse.group</a>) is a moderated and inclusive online forum for discussion and collaboration, which, since May 2020, has attracted 146 active users from all over the world.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/fortranlang', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'ondrej@certik.us', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/wiki/GSoC-2021-Project-ideas                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:45.950044Z | ['python', 'c/c++', 'llvm', 'compiler', 'fortran']                                  | ['science', 'engineering', 'numerical computing', 'libraries', 'high-performance computing']                             | ['Programming languages']    |

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href="https://globalframenet.org" target="_blank">Global FrameNet</a> initiative, an international effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started with <a href="https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley FrameNet</a> in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/FrameNetBrasil', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://framenetbrgsoc.slack.com/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'projeto.framenetbr@ufjf.edu.br', 'name': 'Email'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/summer-of-code/                                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:39.679022Z | ['python', 'mysql', 'javascript', 'php']                                            | ['natural language processing', 'natural language understanding', 'multilinguality', 'multimodal communication']         | ['Data']                     |

This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack.

The freifunk operating system is based on the OpenWrt Linux distribution for embedded devices. Additionally, the distribution contains several extensions for wireless mesh networking. Our local communities contribute to a wide range of different software projects focusing on ad-hoc software services, routing and network protocols, monitoring systems and visualization solutions. For instance, actively developed packages by the community networks are mesh routing protocols like OLSR, BATMAN and Babel.

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/gentoo', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2021/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2021/Application_Guidelines', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://planet.gentoo.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]          | https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2021/Ideas                                                                    | 2022-01-13T14:53:51.771299Z | ['python', 'shell', 'linux', 'c/c++', 'bash']                                       | ['operating systems', 'security', 'automation', 'embedded', 'package']                                                   | ['Operating systems']        |

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/GeomScale', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://gitter.im/GeomScale/community', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'geomscale@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/g/geomscale-gsoc', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://geomscale.github.io/posts/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                   | https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc2021/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects                                                     | 2022-01-13T14:53:30.002303Z | ['python', 'c++', 'r', 'jupyter', 'github-actions']                                 | ['mathematics', 'data science', 'computational biology', 'statistics', 'computation geometry']                           | ['Science and medicine']     |

It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g. the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf" target="_blank">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf</a> ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advices on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e,g. <a href="https://howto.gov.gr/" target="_blank">https://howto.gov.gr/</a> - <a href="https://forma.gov.gr/" target="_blank">https://forma.gov.gr/</a>) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (<a href="https://openedtech.ellak.gr/" target="_blank">https://openedtech.ellak.gr/</a> )</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/gfoss_en', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://ellak.gr/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_Join_GSOC_Matrix_Server', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'info@eellak.gr', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.ellak.gr/gsoc-developers/listinfo.html', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://www.gfoss.eu', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                               | https://ellak.gr/wiki/index.php?title=Google_Summer_of_Code_2021_proposed_ideas                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:28.478196Z | ['python', 'mysql', 'javascript', 'perl', 'python deep learning frameworks']        | ['open hardware', 'python', 'java', 'javascript', 'perl']                                                                | ['Other']                    |

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnss-sdr-developers', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://gnss-sdr.org/google-summer-code-2021-ideas-list/                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:41.291780Z | ['c++11', 'c++14', 'c++17', 'c++20', 'gnss']                                        | ['signal processing', 'gnss', 'navigation', 'software defined radio', 'geospatial']                                      | ['Science and medicine']     |

In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

You probably use it: Mailman is used to manage many project mailing lists from 3-person teams to some of the biggest corporate support operations.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

The algorithm defines the high-level semantics of the program, and the schedule defines the lower-level computation details such as parallelism, order, or storage. The users would define the two separately and explore different ways to accelerate an algorithm. By following this philosophy, we have been able to generate fast Fourier transform code that is faster than fftw, and depthwise separable convolution code that is faster than TensorFlow.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

The organization focuses on providing API designers and developers with automated tools to document, develop and deploy. These tools allow a documentation-first approach that facilitates scaling and maintenance of interoperable nodes in large data repositories. Mentors have four years of experience in leading students to have a productive Summer and get hands-on with Documentation- and Test-driven development; our community is open and collaborative thanks to former students that have become core developers in the past years.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/HydraEcosystem', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://join.slack.com/t/hydraecosystem/shared_invite/zt-ly4j3hg3-gVhJxgc6ykpGrel_N4Xvvg', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'mentors@hydraecosystem.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/w3c-hydra-development-community', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                   | https://www.hydraecosystem.org/gsoc-21                                                                                           | 2022-01-13T14:53:35.699416Z | ['python', 'postgresql', 'javascript', 'redis', 'docker']                           | ['semantic web', 'web services', 'linked data', 'knowledge graphs', 'rest apis']                                         | ['Web']                      |

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/Pocket_Code', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid#contributing', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'contact@catrobat.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://catrob.at/mailinglist', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                 | https://catrob.at/gsoc21                                                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:28.794388Z | ['javascript', 'android', 'swift', 'kotlin', 'php']                                 | ['education', 'visual programming', 'mobile programming', 'game engines', 'creativity tools']                            | ['Programming languages']    |

Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual "Bricks". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special "Bricks" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on "Pocket Code" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

To date we have added more than 15 million Wayback Machine links to articles from 70 Wikipedia language editions.  In most cases those links replaced links that had gone bad, that were returning a 404.  We have also added more than 750,000 links from Wikipedia articles to digital versions of books available from Archive.org that can be previewed and/or borrowed.  We want to expand this effort to include references to our growing collection of serials and journal articles as well as references used in syllabi.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries, which provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes.

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices, algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/libcamera', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://libcamera.org/contributing.html', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'paul.elder@ideasonboard.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://lists.libcamera.org/listinfo/libcamera-devel', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://libcamera.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                      | https://libcamera.org/open-projects.html                                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:26.580547Z | ['c/c++', 'linux kernel', 'qt5', 'gstreamer', 'v4l2']                               | ['camera', 'image processing']                                                                                           | ['Media']                    |

An open-source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station accessible on the web for all the network users. A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 400 stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and tested globally by University satellite teams, organizations, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/librespace_fnd', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://libre.space/community', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'info@libre.space', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://community.libre.space', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://libre.space/category/updates', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                    | https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/soc-org/-/wikis/Google-Summer-of-Code-2021#ideas                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:27.854137Z | ['python', 'django', 'machine learning', 'sdr', 'embedded systems']                 | ['space applications', 'satellite data', 'orbital dynamics', 'space standards']                                          | ['Science and medicine']     |

Virtually every single person on the planet is fascinated by space – at LibreCube we aim to make it accessible to everyone.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for example, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is usually error prone, time consuming and does not add any value to the final product.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python, ... or any language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages. Imagine you don't want to use CPython anymore and you want to try PyPy instead because you need performance. Write a new backend and you will only need to change the language tag <strong>"py"</strong> by <strong>"pypy"</strong> and you are done.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it.

Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/cytoscape', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#profile-tab', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                               | https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues                                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.588203Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'java', 'xml', 'r']                                        | ['web application', 'data science', 'graphics', 'scientific computing', 'network biology']                               | ['Science and medicine']     |

The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/Open_Astronomy', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://openastronomy.org', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'openastronomy.organization@gmail.com', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://openastronomy.org', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                       | https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/gsoc2021/                                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:42.626968Z | ['python', 'javascript', 'julia', 'numba', 'spark']                                 | ['astronomy', 'solar physics', 'high energy astrophysics', 'astrophysics']                                               | ['Science and medicine']     |

Save lives.                                                          | <p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/openmrs', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/IRC/Home', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'community@openmrs.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://talk.openmrs.org', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://blog.openmrs.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                          | https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Summer+Of+Code+2021                                                                         | 2022-01-13T14:53:33.893582Z | ['mysql', 'javascript', 'android', 'java', 'spring']                                | ['science and medicine', 'open source', 'electronic medical records']                                                    | ['Science and medicine']     |

The database, website and api running on our own servers, the editing tools used by contributors to improve the map, and many of the most popular libraries and end-user applications within the OSM software ecosystem are all open source software, and developed through a community-driven process.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue these goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CASPUR</em> consortium found its perfect application.

Version 2 of the app, live since May, 2020, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href="https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite" target="_blank">web-app code repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. We expect version 3, designed for both mobile and desktop for the first time, to begin beta-testing in mid-2021.

A process may rearrange, add to, and remove from its own name space without affecting the name spaces of unrelated processes. This includes the ability to mount a connection to a file server speaking 9P, a simple file protocol. The connection may be a network connection, a pipe, or any other file descriptor open for reading and writing with a 9P server on the other end. Customized name spaces are used heavily throughout the system, to present new resources (e.g., the window system), to import resources from another machine (e.g., the network stack), or to browse backward in time (e.g., the dump file system). For example, device drivers in Plan 9 work by exposing a 9P server, typically mounted in /dev, and can be imported from other systems, transparently.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Inferno took many of the systems-level ideas, combined them with Limbo, a new concurrent programming language, and built them into a system which could run on bare hardware or hosted on another operating system. Plan9port takes many of the user-mode libraries and utilities and enables them to run on Unix-like systems. Each of these extends the ways Plan 9's ideas can be applied to different classes of problems.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

The concurrent programming model in Go came directly from that found in Inferno's Limbo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/processingorg', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'foundation@processing.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://discourse.processing.org/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/processing-foundation', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List                                                                       | 2022-01-13T14:53:52.965389Z | ['python', 'android', 'java', 'opengl', 'javascr']                                  | ['education', 'web', 'graphics', 'creative coding', 'design']                                                            | ['Programming languages']    |

We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

However, it is the Wiki community that created such a giant knowledge base.

There are millions of Tibetan speakers around the world. However, the Tibetan language is much underserviced in the digitized world. For example, it lacks modern NLP technologies such as machine translation, and basic NLP foundations such as tokenization. And existing efforts of knowledge preservation are isolated.

We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication.

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain-specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'https://gitter.im/robocomp/robocomp/robocomp-gsoc', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/robocomp-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://robocomp.github.io/web/gsoc/2021/ideas/                                                                                  | 2022-01-13T14:53:42.784397Z | ['python', 'opencv', 'qt5', 'c++17', 'pytorch']                                     | ['robotics', 'computer vision', 'multi-agent system', 'component-based development']                                     | ['Other']                    |

At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master and Hyperspace Delivery Boy. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run thounsands of games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).

Its long-term mission is to collect, preserve, and share our entire Software Commons, that is the body of knowledge expressed as publicly available software source code. Software Heritage archive both source code and the associated development history, as it is captured by modern version control system and package managers. The data model is a Merkle DAG, where all source code artifacts — file contents, directories, commits,etc. — are thoroughly deduplicated, reducing storage requirements. The <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org" target="_blank">Software Heritage archive</a> is already the largest of its kind, having archive more than 9 billion unique source code files and 2 billion unique commits coming from more than 150 million software projects. The archive crawls periodically forges like GitHub and GitLab.com, distributions like Debian, and package managers like PyPI or NPM. The archive is accessible via a <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org" target="_blank">Web UI</a> as well as a <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api/" target="_blank">WebAPI</a>. The archive serves various different use cases, ranging from preservation of our cultural heritage for posterity to scientific research on "big code" analysis, from business needs of tracking software provenance to educational purposes in computer science curricula.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/swheritage', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://www.softwareheritage.org/community/developers/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'swh-devel@inria.fr', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.softwareheritage.org/community/developers/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://www.softwareheritage.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                  | https://wiki.softwareheritage.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2021                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:31.070104Z | ['python', 'postgresql', 'django', 'git', 'elasticsearch']                          | ['big data', 'digital preservation', 'source code management', 'floss', 'big code']                                      | ['Data']                     |

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. The HPX runtime system is stirring up the pot by providing a modern implementation of all C++ standard facilities related to parallelism and concurrency, extended for the distributed use case.  HPX is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.

The DBMS was originally developed as an in-memory NoSQL DBMS, and later it was extended with a disk storage engine option. Now it is positioned as in-memory computing platform. Tarantool's in-memory engine is lock-free. It uses cooperative multitasking to handle thousands of connections simultaneously. There is a fixed number of independent execution threads and they do not share state. The disk-based storage engine also exploits the advantage of single-threaded requests and hence avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead. Tarantool also supports secondary indexes, asynchronous replication, and some SQL operations.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/tarantooldb', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://t.me/joinchat/IUUJgVz-9_q_8xsD', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'admin@tarantool.io', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://habr.com/ru/hub/tarantool/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                                                                                                | https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/wiki/GSoC-2021                                                                            | 2022-01-13T14:53:43.535208Z | ['c', 'lua', 'sql']                                                                 | ['distributed systems', 'algorithms', 'high performance data processing', 'in-memory data grid']                         | ['Data']                     |

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

A Summer of Code project in Julia is an opportunity to work at the bleeding edge of any of these exciting fields.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/JuliaLanguage', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'https://julialang.org/community/#official_channels', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'jsoc@julialang.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://discourse.julialang.org', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'https://julialang.org/blog/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                     | https://julialang.org/jsoc/projects/                                                                                             | 2022-01-13T14:53:26.630695Z | ['julia', 'julialang']                                                              | ['machine learning', 'data science', 'scientific computing', 'numerical computing', 'technical computing']               | ['Programming languages']    |

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [{'url': 'https://twitter.com/llvmorg', 'name': 'Twitter'}, {'url': 'http://llvm.org/docs/#irc', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'http://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev', 'name': 'Mailing list'}, {'url': 'http://blog.llvm.org/', 'name': 'Blog'}]                                                                                             | http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html                                                                                                | 2022-01-13T14:53:35.465391Z | ['c/c++', 'llvm', 'clang', 'mlir']                                                  | ['compilers', 'code analysis', 'debuggers']                                                                              | ['Programming languages']    |

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.33 in January 2021). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/" target="_blank">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users" target="_blank">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 9500 members as of February 2021, averaging over 8 posts per day. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 295 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p> | [{'url': 'https://www.nsnam.org/develop/tools/chat/', 'name': 'IRC'}, {'url': 'ns-developers@isi.edu', 'name': 'Email'}, {'url': 'https://www.nsnam.org/support/mailing-lists/', 'name': 'Mailing list'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2021Projects                                                                                      | 2022-01-13T14:53:42.392512Z | ['c++', 'python 3']                                                                 | ['simulation', 'emulation', 'network analysis']                                                                          | ['Science and medicine']     |

We also faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

We also want to see how the software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site hosted service like WordPress as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                  |                             |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                          |                              |

Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages.
